## Peer works

TODO: Identify up to 3 works that you see as similar to what you're planning to do. If possible,
highlight particular pages, passages, or sections of those works with brief notes summarizing how
they motivate this project.

1. _`#!` - Nick Montfort_
    
    I appreciate Montfort's use different page background colors with input versus output. This work is also laid out in sections based on the styles exhibited in the works. Montfort has many examples of code that I would be interested in remixing and correlating with my own work. Most of these may be used in my "sandbox" section focused on youth. I think that the pieces "Round" (pgs 2-9), the combinatorics methods of "Taroko Gorge"(pgs 10-17), and the permutations seen in "I AM THAT I AM" (pgs 18-19).

2. _`Travesty Generator` - Lillian-Yvonne Bertram_

    In `Travesty Generator`, I am inspired to use code comments to connect the code even more into the output and product of generative work. This is seen especially in the work "three_last_words" (pgs 11-17). I also like their approach to labelling and presenting all of the iterations of the outputs from an input. This occurs in "Counternarratives" (pgs 18-31), "Husband Stories" (pgs 33-34), "@Tubman's_Rock" (pgs 41-51), "Coming of Age Stories" (pgs 57-59), "Incident" (pgs 60-69). The documentary elements of creating generative poems such as the recording of local time and ^C as see in "@Code_Switching" (pgs 35-38).One specific style I am looking at is the piece "A NEW SERMON ON THE WARPLAND" (pgs 54-56) which is a specific implementation of slotted poetry. 

3. _`Technelegy` - Sasha Stiles_




## Challenges

I have a set of challenges in front of me. Some are interpersonal related to inspiration and motivation. Other problems preventing my work is the technical challenge to code some of the ideas I may have. I am excited to remix some of the methods we have previously looked at. I am unsure how I will branch out beyond. I will start by just approaching some of our earlier work with the knowledge I have now from being in the class. I am also unsure how I will assemble the work in the end. I want to explore how to have both images and text on the same pdf page.
