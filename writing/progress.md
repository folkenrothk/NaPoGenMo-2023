# INFM 350: Project Progress

## Provide a tentative title for the work.

## Description

Progress has been satisfactory to this point in time. The pieces I have created and compiled so far are ready to be presented. I may still reorganize these pieces as I add more. I am having difficulties just with having time and internet access to code at the moment from travel. However, I have been planning and writing down items to work with to create more pieces. I am concerned about achieving the word count but am excited to still attempt to achieve this bar and not needing to count pictures. It has been enjoyable to follow my interests and be able to follow the sparks of creativity. The multiple shorter pieces really captured what I've been intending to present. I need to pursue larger bodies or sections of work like stairwell and my use of the whisper API. My concept has solidified into its memoir state and spoken more to my experience to this point in my life while exercising some strong posthumanism motifs.

## Peer Feedback

1. What are your thoughts about wanting to see the code or know the methods that were used to generate each piece?

2. What themes of memoir do you expect? Are any not present in this current piece?

3. What speaks to you more? Are the pictures too much of a focus or feels unbalanced with the text? 


### Unstructured peer feedback

TODO: Dedicate this space to a summative comment from a peer. This may require you to share
this repository (briefly) with this person for them to replace this paragraph with the comment.

## Persisting challenges

Currently, time has been the biggest challenge. Due to the structure of my work, I can easily adapt or modify my ideas to allow me to explore new methods but not get stuck if I have no desire to fight with it. Another challenge at the moment is the work count. I am current only 1/10th of the way through if I do not count pictures. This may not be a problem soon, but until I generate more content this is still a present issue.
