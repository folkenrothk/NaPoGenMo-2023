## Provide a tentative title for the work.

## Description

Progress has been satisfactory to this point in time. The pieces I have created and compiled so far are ready to be presented. I may still reorganize these pieces as I add more. I am having difficulties just with having time and internet access to code at the moment from travel. However, I have been planning and writing down items to work with to create more pieces. I am concerned about achieving the word count but am excited to still attempt to achieve this bar and not needing to count pictures. It has been enjoyable to follow my interests and be able to follow the sparks of creativity. The multiple shorter pieces really captured what I've been intending to present. I need to pursue larger bodies or sections of work like stairwell and my use of the whisper API. My concept has solidified into its memoir state and spoken more to my experience to this point in my life while exercising some strong posthumanism motifs.

## Peer Feedback

1. What are your thoughts about wanting to see the code or know the methods that were used to generate each piece?

I think that adding the code shows how the images and the text got to how it was.  I think that is almost acts like the building block of this memoir kind of like the experiences of life. I would want to see the methods and code for each peice. 

2. What themes of memoir do you expect? Are any not present in this current piece?

I do like how the project is broken up into diffrent segments of life so far.  I think this speaks to how you have developed as a person.  The only thing that I can think of to add is maybe a section where you show your key take aways from what you have experienced in life.  Another think that could be cool to see is a section of "future work" where you show some how where you see yourself in say 10 years.  While not exsactly consistant with the typical memoir theme, I think that this section could very diffrent from the rest.

3. What speaks to you more? Are the pictures too much of a focus or feels unbalanced with the text? 

I do enjoy the pictures that are included in the work.  To me it feels like the ones with the photos are stronger memories to you which speaks to something.  I would keep the pictures personally.

### Unstructured peer feedback

I do enjoy interpreting the work so far and it does intrege me, I would continue to develop these ideas.  Breaking down the segments and experiences in your life are something that is hard to convey in a format like this yet I feel that you are still effectively doing this task. I think that exporing the previously mentioned ideas would be at least something worth looking into. I am enjoying the work thus far.

## Persisting challenges

Currently, time has been the biggest challenge. Due to the structure of my work, I can easily adapt or modify my ideas to allow me to explore new methods but not get stuck if I have no desire to fight with it. Another challenge at the moment is the work count. I am current only 1/10th of the way through if I do not count pictures. This may not be a problem soon, but until I generate more content this is still a present issue.
