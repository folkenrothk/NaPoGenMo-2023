## Description

  A computationally generated memoir for exploring themes of youth and growing up. This reflects a vague tension between human maturity and technological development.

  Inspired by many works, I bring this piece into the conversation of computationally created works as well as traditionally recognized poetry. I especially want to articulate the inspiration from `"#!" by Nick Montfort`, `"Travesty Generator" by Lillian-Yvonne Bertram`, `"Technelegy" - Sasha Stiles`, and `"You'll Come Back to Yourself" by Michaela Angemeer` .

## Acknowledgements

- @dluman | Thank you for being my mentor. You've only continued to encourage me to be bold and creative in both this sphere of 1s and 0s and out in the world. I hope to continue to generate work I am proud of to share with you. 

- @PaigeCD | Best tech colleague a coder could ask for. Thanks for sitting next to me on the first day and continuing to deal with my never ending questions. Can't wait to see what you do next!
