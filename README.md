## Summary

In this final course project, you will pursue some combination of methods and approaches 
that we've used throughout the semester and/or elaborate your own in relation to the many 
ideas that our readings, discussions, and creative works have introduced. There are two (2) 
major parts to this assignment with a each comprising sub-parts which will allow you to share 
and reflect on your work iteratively throughout the process of creating it.

Please note the various dates below, as there are some interim due dates for progress reports
and bringing unfinished, in-progress work. These are important as they are chances for you to
show and discuss your ideas and approches. I trust and hope that these requirements are as generative
as they are evaluative.

## Goals

* develop a long-form work rooted in a single concept or cluster of closely-related concepts
* closely explore the opportunities and/or limitations of a generative method or approach
* reflect on the efficacy, value, and impact of the technologies involved and their implications for creativity
* relate your work to others that we have studied this semester in an effort to situate your efforts

But really, produce a work of:

*  _no fewer than_ 30,000 words
* _no more than_ 49,999 words
* is related to `3` of the works we've read this semester
* is in PDF or other non-Markdown form, with
  * a title page
  * a Table of Contents (if appropriate)
  * a list of references (if appropriate)

### Outcomes

(These are derived from, but supercede the [NaPoGenMo](https://github.com/NaPoGenMo/NaPoGenMo2023) guidelines.)

* the above-referenced work
* (Optional) submission to this year's [NaPoGenMo](https://github.com/NaPoGenMo/NaPoGenMo2023) effort

### Code

You are largely on your own for this project; I provide no "starter" here. This means you area free to innovate and
include tools we _haven't_ used to date or to bring tools in from other projects. The only rule is that:

* you must place your source code in the `src` directory

### Writing

There are three (3) writing assignments accompanying this project.

|Due Date |Description |Document |
|:--------|:-----------|:--------|
|7 April  |Project Plan |[writing/plan.md](writing/plan.md) |
|19 April |Progress Report |[writing/progress.md](writing/progress.md) |
|9 May    |Final reflection|[writing/reflection.md](writing/reflection.md) |

### Workshops and schedule

This assignment honors our original routine of Wednesday informal feedback and Friday formal feedback except that, unlike
previous weeks these are not optional (i.e. subject to the evaluation grid in the [Course Contract](https://github.com/allegheny-college-infm-350-spr-2023/course-materials/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). There is at least one change, so to enumerate expectations:

* you will be given dates on which we will discuss your work (during Friday sessions)
* anyone not being workshopped _must_ respond to the work discussed during Friday sessions
* missing more than one (1) of these posts will constitute an incomplete final project
