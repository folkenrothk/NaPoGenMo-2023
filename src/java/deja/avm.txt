To access the heart, the brain must be revealed,
So follow these steps with careful appeal.
First, power off and unplug from the wall,
And find the screws holding the cover in thrall.

With screwdriver in hand, twist with care,
Until the cover slides off without a tear.
The CPU, the brain, the heart of the beast,
Lies nestled beneath, toiling without cease.

The fan may be blocking, so remove with ease,
To reveal the CPU, the key to all the pleas.
With a gentle touch, lift the lever with care,
And remove the CPU, so tiny and rare.

Replacing the heart is a delicate art,
So make sure the fit is true from the start.
Lower the lever, secure it in place,
And reattach the fan, with a steady embrace.

With cover replaced and screws tightened down,
The computer will awaken without a frown.
And with a new brain, it will hum and purr,
Performing its tasks with more speed and sure.
