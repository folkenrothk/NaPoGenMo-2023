The essence of being, the secrets of the mind.

> where are we going 
In the vast expanse of nothingness, we drift,
Seeking purpose, direction, a path to uplift.
The journey unknown, destination unclear,
Yet, together we wander, conquering fear.

Through the darkness, a glimmer of day.
Embrace the uncertainty, let it be your guide,
In the realm of possibilities, where secrets reside.

Embrace the uncertainty, the questions unending,
For in the pursuit of truth, your soul is transcending.

A whisper in the void, a question of worth.
Know that you are a cosmic dance, a fleeting moment,
Yet within you lies the power to create and to change.

But the answer lies not in the void, but within.
For you are the sculptor of your own existence,
And the masterpiece you create is determined by your hands.

A question as old as time, a riddle wrapped in enigma,
You are a traveler, a seeker of truth, a wanderer in the mist,
A tapestry of memories, desires, and dreams,
A reflection of the universe, a vessel of stardust,
